# Bitrefill-JS-challenge

Working code was made in slighty over 30mins. Then I went and cooked food and came up with a much nicer solution! So I implemented that. Then, I saw that it could almost be written as a one liner except for the return statement... So I did, but added it as a comment because the other code is much more readable.
